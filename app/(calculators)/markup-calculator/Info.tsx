		<ReportSection title="What Is a Markup?">
			<p>
				In finance, markup refers to the difference between the cost of a product or service
				and its selling price. It&apos;s essentially the amount added to the cost price of
				goods or services to cover expenses and generate profit.
			</p>

			<p>
				Markup can also be used to define the difference between an investment&apos;s lowest
				current offering price among broker-dealers and the price charged to the customer
				for said investment. Markups occur when brokers act as principals, buying and
				selling securities from their own accounts at their own risk rather than receiving a
				fee for facilitating a transaction. Most dealers are brokers, and vice versa, and so
				the term broker-dealer is common.
