		<ReportSection title="What Is Dollar-Cost Averaging?">
			<p>
				Investing can be challenging. Even experienced investors who try to time the market
				to buy at the most opportune moments can come up short.
			</p>

			<p>
				Dollar-cost averaging is a strategy that can make it easier to deal with uncertain
				markets by making purchases automatic. It also supports an investor&apos;s effort to
				invest regularly.
			</p>

			<p>
				Dollar-cost averaging involves investing the same amount of money in a target
				security at regular intervals over a certain period of time, regardless of price. By
				using dollar-cost averaging, investors may lower their average cost per share and
				reduce the impact of volatility on the their portfolios.
			</p>

			<p>
				In effect, this strategy eliminates the effort required to attempt to time the
				market to buy at the best prices.
			</p>

			<p>Dollar-cost averaging is also known as the constant dollar plan.</p>
