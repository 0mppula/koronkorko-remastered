		<ReportSection title="What Is an Investment Time Horizon?">
			<p>
				An investment time horizon, or just time horizon, is the period of time one expects
				to hold an investment until they need the money back or want to rach a certain
				financial goal. Time horizons are largely dictated by investment goals and
				strategies. For example, saving for a down payment on a house, for maybe two years,
				would be considered a short-term time horizon while saving for college would be a
				medium-term time horizon, and investing for retirement, a long-term time horizon.

						Time horizons also vary according to the time by which you begin investing.

					<li>
						The longer the time horizon, the longer the power of compounding has to
						work.

						Generally speaking, the longer the time horizon, the more aggressive an
						investor can be in their portfolio, and vice versa.
